This implements the https://github.com/kermit4/cjp2p protocol.

This is very insecure, just a prototype for using BASH because I like BASH.

Unfortunately BASH's networking capability was limited so it needed some Rust to use the socket.

It's fairly slow, topping out at 30Mbps on my Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz
